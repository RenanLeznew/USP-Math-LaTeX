# USP-Math-LaTeX
A respository to upload LaTeX works done during my undergradute years in University of SÃ£o Paulo - Braz

# About Me and the Project

Hello! My name is Renan, I'm currently going through an undegraduation on mathematics at University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP). I'm using this repository to save some notes and solutions to exercises that have been asked to be done. Each folder will correspond to a subject, and I might organize them by year in the future. For now, I just hope this may be useful to other people who might need this. 

If everything goes accordingly, this repository will be updated (at least) monthly, and while it is just for exercises at the moment I'm writing this, I might add in some classes notes and some personal study projects too. ðŸ˜€
